This is an example of an accordian menu using javascript, jquery, and css. The trickiest part was getting the transition to work. In order for it to work a height needs to be defined. Unfortunately, just writing height 100% does no good. The next challenge was clearing the other content when one was already done. Using a clear function I removed the class which displayed the element as a block rendering it to its default state of display:none. Once calling it on each event twice it worked like clockwork.
